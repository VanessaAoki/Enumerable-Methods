## Basic Enumerable Methods

This project consists of an implementation of my own version of following Ruby’s enumerable methods:

- Each;
- Each with index;
- Select;
- All?;

- Count;
- Map;
- Inject.

> If you have any questions about one of the methods above, consider checking the [notes](./Notes.md) file.
